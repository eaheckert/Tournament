# Tournament README #

### What is this repository for? ###
This is a Swift version of an app I started working on perviously [here](https://github.com/ludomade/Tournament-iOS). My main goal for this is to learn how to program in Swift using Objective-C source code that I already know.

### Who do I talk to? ###
Current primary developer can be reached at eaheckert@gmail.com
