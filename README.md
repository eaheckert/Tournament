# Tournament README #

### What is this repository for? ###
This is a Swift version of an app I started working on perviously [here](https://github.com/ludomade/Tournament-iOS). My main goal for this is to learn how to program in Swift using Objective-C source code that I already know.

### How do I get set up? ###

1. ####Create a Parse App####
    1. Goto [Parse.com](https://www.parse.com/) and signup/login.
    2. Click on create a new app
    3. Give it a name. I use "Tournament"

1. ####Create keys.plist####
    1. Right click on Supporting Files New File > Resource > Property List.
    2. Name it "keys" and save it to any location you wish.
    3. Add "parseClientKey" and "parseApplicationId".

1. ####update keys.plist####
    1. From the Parse dashboard hoover over the gear icon for the related app
    2. Select Keys
    3. parseApplicationId needs the value from Application ID
    4. parseClientKey needs the value from Client Key

### Latest Update ###
